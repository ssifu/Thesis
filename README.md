# Utility Bill Payment System Using Blockchain Technology
Utility bill payment using blockchain technology as the foundation. for making bill paying less complicated, safer, and susceptible to financial difficulties and tax fraud. In Bangladesh, payment systems for utilities, VAT, and tolls are now available online. But they are not always secure and are vulnerable to hacking. Due to their high vulnerability to cyberattacks and the fact that Bangladesh is a third-world country, other countriesâ€™ hackers may find it simple to target Bangladesh. Additionally, dishonest individuals like tax fraudsters may falsify data or alter the system for their own self-serving purposes, putting regular users or taxpayers in a position where their hard-earned money might well be stolen without anybody noticing. The value of foreign money is rising steadily, and there is little evidence of its stability at the moment. This adds to the problem of inflation in Bangladesh. Compared to other countries, the value of the Bangladeshi currency is strangely falling. Since cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, which are prone to inflation and have their ups and downs but whose economic rate graph is always exponential and rising over time, may be used in place of traditional payment methods for taxes or bills, this can greatly improve the situation.
